# Diamonds Data Exploration

## Dataset

> This cleaned data set contains information about 6,160 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including 6 columns ['popularity','directors','vote_average','release_year','budget_adj','revenue_adj'].
and there is another special data created for answeing some quistions about directors and it contains 2958 different directors with 4 features of mean of ['budget_adj', 'popularity', 'revenue_adj', 'vote_average', 'release_year'].
The dataset can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata),


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between the
budget and its revenues, also There is an approximately relationship 
linear between vote average and revenues and we could analyse that from the main factors of the success as a director in most people's opinion which are the popularity and the revenues , we could notice that the budget is not the only factor to be successful as there is only two of the top 20 bubget spender who could be seucceful in our assumption so we can say that the big budget is not the only factor to success there is a lot of factors and i think that the most important one is the creativity.
we could deeply understand the relationship between the revenue and the budget most of times the budget affects positively on the revenues but on the other side to be one of the best you or the more you want to get high the the more budget effect decreases as there is lots of factor to be one of the best except the budget.

By the time, people's interest into movies increases alot so that the money spend to satisfy those people increases and the revenue from them for sure.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the revenues and the success of directors so I start by introducing the
relation ships between the vote average or the budget anr revenue, then plot the scatterplot and the linear regression.
and i tried to put the time on this analysis so we noticed that over years, people's interests into movies increases so budget and revenues.

Afterwards, i introduced the top 20 popularity directors and noticed that there is only two of them in top 20 budget spenders and did it so but with revenues instead of popularity and finally noticed that there is only two directors who could solve the equation and could be on of the top 20 budget spenders and popularity and revenues.
